# TOHacks2021
 TOHacks 2021 project.
 
# Objective
Travelling during these pandemic times have become highly restricted and extremely covid-19 conscious. As you would expect, different countries and travel destinations have varying degrees of covid-19 statistics and ,therefore, varying restraints and requirements towards entering the country. We set out to create an application that provides an easy search and data retrieval on locations that a user inputs and provides all required information in one place. It makes it easier for one to view information on the countries they want to travel to without having to do multiple google searches to do so.
